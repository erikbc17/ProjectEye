CCTV imagery classification of firearms in still imagery frames
This project presents the application of using Machine Learning (specifically a convolutional neural network) to identify gun objects in a video recording by frames. The original scope of this project was to aid TSA to have more time on their hands as well as provide a secondary layer of security for airports across the country. However, due to time constraints,
the team had to limit the scope to any type of video recordings only. First, the team collected over 400 thousands of images containing both gun and no-gun categories. Then, dividing 1000 images from the original image set for testing, and the rest was used for training. As a result, the loss and accuracy are somewhat acceptable with the loss being 10 to 40% and the accuracy
ranging from 80 to 90%. Furthermore, the team tested the trained model by showing some random gun images on webcam, and thus concluding the necessity for future improvements for full adaptation and integration into a CCTV system.
